## 🧠 Purpose

To enable fast, low-tech screen recording for documenting and demonstrating real skill development — without relying on polished production or AI-only outputs. This setup empowers both the learner (Link) and others using LinkOS to prove their knowledge through authentic walkthroughs.

## ✅ Key Outcomes

### 1. **Scripted, Minimal Screen Recording System**
- Created `start_linkos_recording.sh`
- Prompts user if this is a Bootcamp recording or Freeform session
- Organizes files into:
  - `~/Videos/LinkOS_Demos/DayXX/`
  - `~/Videos/LinkOS_Extras/`
- Brings SimpleScreenRecorder (SSR) GUI forward using `wmctrl`

### 2. **Plank Dock Integration**
- Custom `.desktop` launcher created and tested
- Proper `Exec=` line format ensured terminal and SSR launched reliably
- Final solution used:
  ```ini
  Exec=xfce4-terminal -H -e "bash -c '/usr/local/bin/start_linkos_recording.sh; exec bash'"
  ```
- Icon updated for visual clarity (e.g., `Icon=multimedia-video`)
- Manually dragged to Plank for persistent shortcut

### 3. **YouTube and Social Media Strategy**
- Upload **full walkthroughs** to YouTube (Unlisted recommended)
- Store links in `video_demo_link.txt` or Obsidian entries
- Use `ffmpeg` to create short clips for TikTok, LinkedIn, or IG Reels

  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i video.mkv -ss 00:01:00 -t 00:00:30 -vf scale=720:-1 clip.mp4
  ```

### 4. **Backup and Archiving**
- Local USB backup using `rsync`
  ```bash
  rsync -avh ~/Videos/LinkOS_Demos/ /mnt/usb/LinkOS_Recordings/
  ```
- Future cloud backup using `rclone` or GDrive
- All important recordings will be retained offline and cataloged

## 🔧 Tools Used
- `SimpleScreenRecorder`
- `wmctrl` (to raise windows)
- `ffmpeg` (for social media clip generation)
- XFCE + Plank
- `bash`, `mousepad`, `chmod`, `cp`, `ln -s`

---

## 💡 Reflections

> “Unpolished. Unscripted. Understood.”

This workflow helps ensure:
- The learner isn't just copying and pasting with AI
- Each day’s learning is demonstrable and self-contained
- Portfolio evidence is **visible, honest, and scalable**

The entire setup reinforces LinkOS as a **project-driven learning distro**, and Link2Cyber as a **proof-of-skill platform**.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Start daily recordings for TryHackMe, bootcamp walkthroughs, and Link2Cyber development
- Add `video_demo_link.txt` to each GitHub project folder
- Include this system as part of `/etc/skel` in future LinkOS ISOs
- Begin YouTube playlist organization
